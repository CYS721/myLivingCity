jt2OHQh0HoQ,"This video was too long. Halfway through it, I got hungry so I left it playing and went to the kitchen to fix my self a sandwich. But then I found out that I'm out of mayonnaise so I went to a store. There, I saw the most beautiful woman I have ever seen in my whole life. But I'm really a shy person so I took up a three-year personality development course so I can introduce my self. She was very friendly and all, but unfortunately, she has a boyfriend. So I said, all good, I'm a mature person. I want the best for her and I harbor no illusion that I am the best person for her and she seems happy with her boyfriend, so I did not bother her anymore. But we kept in touch and we became friends and I got over my crush on her. Then she broke up with her boyfriend, we drank some alcohol because of it, I told her she'll be fine and I wished her well. I still think she's the most beautiful woman in the world, but like I said, I am over my crush on her. It was like five years already when I first saw her. Besides, I am quiet happy with the friendship I developed with her. It was more important than a crush. So we kept hanging out, drinking, having coffee, and all. I had a girlfriend, she started dating other guys. My girlfriend wants to live some other life without me in it, so I said, okay, I want the best for you and I want you to pursue your happiness. My lady friend and I drank alcohol about it, and she gave me the same advice I gave her when she was in that position and I became okay with the breakup immediately. But we were really drunk, so she spent the night in my apartment. I only have one bed, so you know what that means: She took the bed and I slept on the couch. But on the couch, I really can't sleep. Something was bothering me. So I tossed and turned for about three hours, then I finally can't take it anymore, I stood up and went straight to my room where she's sleeping. I approached the bed, gently sat on it and I reached for her shoulder to pull her closer to me. She stirred and woke up. She asked what's up. I told her, you know, the first time I saw you, I was watching a video and left it playing to get my self a sandwich then went to the store to get some mayo then I got distracted by life that I forgot to finish the video. She said, you know what, I've been wondering about a weird noise in your night drawer. So we opened that drawer, and lo and behold, there's my phone and this video still has two minutes of play time on it.",0,1,['0. Neutral  | 1. Share  | 2. Woman  | 3. Friendship  | 4.

QBGaO89cBMI,"Radiohead ha estrenado un nuevo videoclip para su canción “Lift“, uno de los temas inéditos incluidos en el lanzamiento de OKNOTOK, la reedición de Ok Computer por su vigésimo aniversario, que se puso a la venta en junio. Se trata de una de las canciones que quedaron guardadas cuando la banda británica estaba componiendo uno de los álbumes más influyentes de su carrera: El OK Computer (1997).\nDos décadas después, el tema vio la luz en OKNOTOK. La reedición incluye el disco original, las 8 caras b y tres temas inéditos que el grupo ha tocado en directo pero cuyas versiones de estudio jamás han visto la luz. Estas son “Man of War” y “I Promise“ y Lift, todas ya con su correspondiente nuevo vídeoclip.\nLas imágenes de Lift están dirigidas por el británico Oscar Hudson, que ha trabajado con la banda desde el lanzamiento de A Moon Shaped Pool (2016). En este vídeoclip vemos un surrealista viaje en ascensor protagonizado por el vocalista del grupo, Thom Yorke.  En el trayecto se encuentra con diversos personajes y situaciones, pero como se indica en la canción, no todo es lo que parece.\nMúsica independiente novedades.",0,0,

r4RfsfD6ZhM,"How exactly does one get pussy while living at the white house as a teenage boy? The secret service always cock blocking you. when you're trying to run game on some foreign prime ministers daughter the news media catches you smiling at her and immediately blows shit out if proportion speculating that you are somehow breaking international law with your awkward teenage flirting, so you have to testify before congress that you didn't give away any top secret documents to her and are made to admit live on C-SPAN that you've never even kissed a girl . Then you get blue balls from some hot conservative girl winking at you and flashing her panties under her skirt and making sexy faces and blow job motions to you while you were going through some airport or public event, and when you passed by and shook her hand she leans in whispering she is going to diddle her clit thinking about you tonight and how much she wants to suck your dick off, just to fuck with you. Then you try to look up some porn when you get home just to relieve the tension but you just know the CIA is monitoring and 3 other govornment agencies are watching you beat off. Then you finally break down and Jack off in the shower which sets off some fucking biohazard drain alarm and the entire place is on lock down until they can find the source of the specimen and you end up getting debriefed by the joint chiefs of staff about your masturbatory habits and how you almost created a national security issue with your dick. Then wikileaks leaks your search history showing you looked up penis enlargement techniques when it was actually just some click bait you'd accidentally clicked and TYT spends all next week talking about your supposed micro penis. So you end up squirming a little since you are so wound up and being judged constantly and now people are saying you look like a fucking mental patient and you start to think you'll never get any pussy. #YIAYfetish",0,0,

ql0Op1VcELw,"I know train isn't really popular in the US, but I highly doubt that electric planes will be in concurrence with trains in Europe. Distances here are really shorter and the major advantage of train stations is that as they were pretty much all built in the late 1800's/early 1900's at the periphery of cities, they are now the heart of the cities. You get down the train and you are immediately where you need to be (most of the times with a lot of easy public transportations). Take Paris for example : its 4 majors train stations are all in the middle of the city while you need at least 30 more minutes to get back from airports to the centre (not even counting the checks and everything). That being said, even if we laugh a lot about it, train transportation is very developped and popular here in France, with high-quality high speed railways and a great local network and there might be a hole to fill in other countries, especially in the US with congested traffic",0,0,

ql0Op1VcELw,"I disagree that the B757 is showing age, the 767 flew before it and it's still in high transatlantic use. Plus they're fuel efficient, so there's no need. If airlines are still flying 747s across the pond which is 20yrs older, that means 757/767 still have at least 25yrs left in them. How about Boeing just create a NEO project for the 757? Quieter and even more fuel efficient, especially with those really loud Rolls Royce versions, but then again I love engine noise, I miss that at the airport. The NOISE, the smoke trails from DC9s, 727s and 737-200s. Eventually airlines and all transportation industries are gonna have to search for alternative energy sources, its inevitable.

But a supersonic flight, even if one had been available (it wasn't), wouldn't have cost *a little extra* but probably would have been *twice* as expensive, and I couldn't afford that.\n\nIf we want supersonic airliners, luxurious airliners, gigantic airliners, we need to get wages up.

When taking into account that the train is _considerably_ more comfortable (more leg room, free to walk around at all times, no changing transportation three times, no long waits, ) I just don't see air travel ever beating the rail unless it gets considerably cheaper (which probably won't happen, since any advantage in electric transport that improves ticket prices for planes is bound to also improve them for trains ).",0,0,

Using cheap clean nuclear power to create a carton neutral high energy density fuel (much higher than any battery by many factors) is a much better solution and a much more likely one.

ql0Op1VcELw,"I have a couple issues with this video.\nThe question is not how much oil we have left but how much of it we may still burn.\nIf we keep drilling for and burning fossile oil at the same rate right now it will very soon let the effects of it, specifically global warming exponentionally worsen. It is true that we might have decades of fossile fuels left over, but we can’t ever burn that all if we would want to keep this planet an inhabitable home for many further generations.\n\nThe plane of the future in my subjective opinion is a zero-emission, perhaps solar-powered or at least “green” energy loaded aircraft with about the capacity of a rather small long-haul airliner and the range of this new Boeing 797 concept.\nBy 2030 already, we will have about 1,000,000,000 more people living on earth than now and this leads me to being concerned more about the regular medium to short-haul travel than a couple transatlantic flights.\nThere will be a point when our usual short to medium-haul airliners like the 737 will not be capable of running the routes they fly anymore because of capacity issues. More and more people are living on earth and the percentage of people using air traffic as their mean of transport is increasing just as quick.\nAirlines like Swiss, Austrian and British already use 777s and 767s for routes like Vienna - Frankfurt, Zurich - Vienna and London - Amsterdam. And that is only one of countless flights on these routes each day. If zero-emission aircraft don’t become a reality, running larger capacity, fuel efficient planes a couple less times a day rather than more low-capacity aircraft will over a long course perhaps be the better solution for our planet, air congestion, those affected by aircraft noise and so on and so forth. It may make us dispense with comfort in terms of frequency of flights and travel times, but I don’t think I have to elaborate that our earth is more valuable than arriving somewhere one hour earlier or later.",2,0,

j6fn3LfIfww,"Hi Bubz! I have watched you since before you were married and I am basically committed to watching your videos still, I love it so much! I'm sure you guys know what you're doing but due to my own past experiences i sort of became worried for Lala because my mom tried her best not to neglect my older brother and instead she neglected me. even giving me to my grandma really did some damage to me because i didn't know what a mother's love was supposed to be like growing up. Again, i think you guys know what you're doing and i only see glimpses of what goes on, through your videos. But please don't let ayla be removed from your presence for too long or she could feel disconnected with you, as to this day (been praying for God to restore my family) i have felt disconnected with my own family. please do keep me in prayer as well as you can see i need it, haha. anyway, it was a small worry, but i'm sure you guys know what you're doing, and i'm sorry if this came off the wrong way.

As a person who also has anxiety and gets panic attacks it was quite difficult to make the link as I thought all of my symptoms were a combination of PMS and anxiety but through reading into it, it's obvious to me that that is what I have. Would love to see a video on how PMS makes you feel, more tips on how you deal with it and have us all have a chat about it in the comments because whether it be PMS or PMDD it can be very negative and lonely going through it.

I was just really loving this video (and for quite a while her whole channel as well) up to that point, so seeing her give him a shoutout kind of caught me off guard. Maybe I'm getting biased info, but from what I''ve read he's a bigot... or at least not the man he appears to be from her description ...

itGLQk8oY2Q,All this gender rubbish is getting completely out of hand now. As a mother of a child who cannot yet make her own decisions you havr every right to dress her however you see fit. I'm a few years older and i cannot remember this ever being an issue when i was a kid. Parents dressed their kids in whatever they felt like. I had a Thomas the tank engine cardigan and postman pat jumper that i would happily wear when i was wearing a pretty frock. Many friends and relatives would have hand me down toys and clothes that weren't necessarily the 'right' gender for them. But they didn't care. Why? Because they were a damn kid and stuff like that didn't matter. If you're trying to force a teenage boy to wear a dress then that's another story. Sometimes things like clothes and toys are gendered. Get over it. Buy what you feel like.,0,0,

itGLQk8oY2Q,Hi Sammi! I'm not sure if you'll see this but I'm about 4 months postpartum with my second and with my first I had a lot of postpartum depression and anxiety so I was determined to handle it better the next time around. I've been taking Evening Primrose Oil supplement (it's suppose to help regulate hormones) as well as a vitamin B complex supplement with my multivitamin and it has really helped me out. Also if it's a cloudy day and I can't get out in the sun I take a Vitamin D3 supplement. I hope this helps in any way. I know postpartum issues can be so debilitating and then having your life public for criticism must not make it any easier 😕 but I love your videos and have always admired your honestly!,0,0,

itGLQk8oY2Q,You say how difficult it is for Asian/tan/black girls to find their perfect shade and make it seem easy for white girls to get the perfect shade. I agree to an extent but as a Scottish pale skinned girl (super pale I may add) I've never found my perfect shade. I'm still having to mix two foundations to get a decent colour that somewhat matches me because I find everything is either too pink or yellow toned. It's wonderful that Fenty has created so many shades so that all of us can find something that is hopefully perfect. I shall definitely try it out!,4,3,

4MkC65emkG4,"Look up HAARP my friends, and the real question that these celebrities need to be asking. Why if we have the technology of cloud seeding through laser shooting at particles to create rain and we been manipulating the weather for decades now. Why didn't we redirected or stopped the hurricanes? \n\nEven famous physicists Michio Kaku admits to this geoengenering on a cbs news interview.  \nI wish it didn't happen and all natural disasters are a horrible thing for anyone to endure. And my heart goes out to all the victims and will continue to support. But it is so sad to find out that tragic events like this can be man made at times. So I pray that many of you become aware of what's really taking place in this reality and give your life to God, he won't disappoint you. \nAnd I pray that this whole event about helping is not just an agenda to promote and push coexistence, globalism and unity. Their religion of occult  New Age/mysticism and rise of their Antichrist/alien god to bring their New World Order, which they believe, chaos must be created in order to bring Order. Where with their mind witch powers and advance alien/demon technology they can create  almost anything they can imagine. \nDon't get me wrong please, helping is awesome as I'm praying for everyone including the celebrities participating and even those who have sold their souls for riches and fame, is not to late for redemption! I'm praying for you. But really hope this is not all orchestrated for a different agenda, don't forget that the road to hell is paved with good intentions. Time to read our Bibles and take a close look at  the book of Revelation chapter 13,  Daniel 12 and Luke 21.\nStay strong Texas, Florida, all the Caribbean and to all those affected. May you find peace and joy in Christ Jesus even in the middle of the struggles. Remember man and Satan  can only hurt the physical body or the material but can't never have our souls if we believe we are Gods children and the only way to be redeemed and adopted into Gods family is by Jesus Christ our Savior, there's no short cuts and Satan is a liar so don't fall for the lies because religion kills and condemns the soul, only a true relationship with Father God through Jesus saves.

That being said, I find myself for some reason having to defend him not because I support racial slurs, but because of the MASSIVE double standard regarding them and the outright abuse of the DMCA in response to it. \n     The fact of the matter is that the DMCA was written BY monolithic corporations FOR monolithic corporations and they repeatedly misuse it with little concern of negative consequences since it is stacked so unbelievably in their favor. \n    Could this be used to destroy what we know of as Fair Use? Yeah, it could, but ultimately I see that as the force that would finally take DOWN the DMCA as we know it. \n    Europe has much more restrictive ideas of 'Free Speech' than here in the States, and it is true that it's not a free speech issue, legally, when it's solely in the hands of a private corporation (even IF said corporation HOSTS an UNBELIEVABLE amount of speech).

Apart from some percent of brainless radical racist idiots, I think most of us agree that the N-word is infamous for a reason - it has a horrible background history and hateful meaning. But for some time now it's also been used in a wide variety of contexts that extend far outside of this word's common definition. \n\nAnd what actually is offensive about it is not the word itself but the context behind it. It became a common sense thing to just not use it to avoid confusion and stop any possible abuse coming from using it. Hence, PDP slipping it out was a really stupid example of lack of self-control where it clearly should step in on literally every word he's saying (considering his non deniable influence on many people). But when you look at the situation he was in and examine the moment of the commented reaction it becomes more and more doubtful if this word in this particular moment had a true racist context. it was clearly offensive and insulting towards the PUBG player but not really that racist in general. \nThus PDP should be smacked for using the word but calling him straight up racist is just an example of reckless hate bandwagon causing the drama to be more exposed than the actual bad word itself.\n\nPeople should be educated why this word is an abuse and why it shouldn't be ever used. All this drama consisting of people actually only throwing insults at PDP is showing that what matters are pitchforks and torches, especially in 'mass vs 1' setting, leaving educational aspect far behind hardly justified rage.",0,0,

When he's livestreaming, he is on the job no matter how cool or freeform the job. \nYou do not say that word when you are at your work. Period. Try to apply your arguments to your mum and see how it works for you.\n\nAnd beyond that, if you are so against the N word being considered a racial slur, then advocate for it in a manner with a legitimate argument. Don't go just saying it for the sakes of saying it.",0,0,
Odoe1qVkcJ4,"I fully agree on the Pdp part.\nEither YouTube regulates itself, for example enforcing their community guidelines or just making use of laws, or, and in my opinion more likely, the current YouTube will fail.\n\nAs for why enforcing some guidelines is important:\nIf the CEO of some minor company, let me take Tim Cook as an example because he is in the media from time to time, were to swear on a press conference. The entirety of the Apple shareholders would demand him to step down. Not because the word used was bad, but because his behaviour is inappropriate. Companies working with Apple would be happy as their business partner has some standards and move on.\nOn Youtube however, advertisers (business parterns of Google) see no actions at all! Working with a company that has no standards is to be avoided, or else your shareholders, customers and business parterns will give up on you.\n\nAnother issue is the audience of said channels. They are young and do not know any better. Guess how we got all the screaming and swearing children in voice channels.\nTheir idol is screaming and swearing all the time! It is logical to them to behave the same. The sterotypical 12 year old is co-produced of YouTube not regulating anything. Laissez-faire has failed years ago.\n\nNow that the waves get higher, we see the storm comming.",0,0,

Personally, I think, as a replacement for Last Week, you should do a bi-weekly or monthly vlog series. I don't want to lose that feel I get from this series or the excitement I have when I see a new upload that just won't be present with a static, talky podcast.\n\nI commend you for making it to the end of this wall of text, and I hope others agree with me.

I can't use any of my matte foundations anymore and I basically have to switch up my entire routine. I would say it is still worth it though!,0,0,
3yoGE3v4A8w,"Oooh I like this one - the ELDWN not the LL!.  Is it my imagination or did the swatch of this look really similar to the swatch of the Dermacol 208?  Since that's my perfect shade, this cool bone one might be as well (at least in this formula anyway).  The same colour in the other formula being so different - I wonder if there was some sort of a mix-up and it was mislabeled since it looked so different (it actually looked way to yellow to be called cool anything).",0,0,

And that's when the horror started. Twice a week, they would drag me screaming to the water. Bless the coach, she was very understanding and was very slow in advancing me, she kept me behind on the others as she slowly tries to break away the fear from me (Which she did, again, bless the coach) and then, that's when they discovered that I really can fucking swim.\nDo you want to know how I can swim but fear the water? My dad threw me in the sea, far away from the beach, with only a floaty jacket thing on me.

Everybody is like you, they are all clueless and trying to find new friends so they will be glad you approached them\nI've studied for 4 years now and that are the most important things imo.",0,0,

Also, the Ravens were set to sign him, and his gf sends out a racist as f tweet that ruined the deal, as Ray Lewis has been attesting to.\nThere are studies that have been done showing the NFL's loss in viewership was directly tied to these anthem protests, so if a player is already bad and does this shit, none of you can act shocked or disgusted when they get cut.\nThe owners have a vested interest in keeping viewership up.

I was wondering if you have any suggestions of any YouTubers that have good make up suggestions/tutorials for olive skin. I love how you do your makeup.

They are not metallic at all.  When I was growing up metallic lipsticks were called frosted and everyone wore light pink frosted lipsticks.  I think some light metallic lipsticks are pretty, but the lipsticks with actual glitter are not my cuppa tea.  Thank you again, Fleur for a wonderful video.",0,0,

ppGCbh8ggUs,"not sure if this video is purposely misleading or not, but from what I've learned Spartan heiresses inherited half, to less than half, of that which was divided among male children. Spartan heiresses could not determine who they married. It was arranged by some sort of guardian or ruling body, not by themselves. Once married, a Spartan heiress' inheritance would be granted to the control of her husband - the catch is, he would most likely be at war, training for war, or investing himself in politics, far too busy to run household business. \n\nHowever Athenian scholars have suggested that it was Spartan women who contributed to the demise of Sparta herself. As inheritance grew, so did entitlement, and women married later and later, sometimes choosing to not have children at all. To a diminishing Sparta outnumbered (as I've heard) up to 10-to-1, this was a death knoll. Lack innovation. Lack of conscription. Xenophobia. Fear of trade. Women who the Greeks considered overly entitled and outright unruly, thus slowing, if not halting all together the supply of Spartan stock... everything was a powder keg. \n\nBegrudgingly, Spartans had to eventually let Helots join their military ranks just to fill the gaps. And then... there were nearly as many helot warriors trained up as Spartans as their were Spartan citizens. A unique, but over all failure of a government strategy. Yes they created the first constitution. Yes the practiced oligarchy, democracy, aristocracy and duoarchy at the same time - kinda reminds me of the States. Yes the Spartan government lasted longer than Athenian democracy (also a huge failure). But No, no, no, could Sparta sustain itself. It did good for like, what, 400 years? But little room for growth or upward mobility. Shame.",0,0,

ppGCbh8ggUs,"The Spartan decline is due to the Thebans under Epaminondas freeing the helots of messania from their captive state. The Thebans decisively defeated the spartans at the battle of Leuctra, and marched on into their heartlands. While not being able to conquer Sparta itself, Epaminondas moved into Messenia and freed the helots there. This was a third of Sparta's land, and about half of the helot population. To make sure the Messenians would remain a free people he rebuild the city of Messene, and with it build some of the strongest fortifications in all of Greece.\n\nWhile Epaminondas died a few years later and Thebe as a major power with him, the Spartans never recovered from this defeat. It meant that the Spartans could no longer field there entire male population as an army, for the simple reason that there were not enough helots to feed and supply them. It was also a huge moral defeat, as both the Spartans as the rest of the Greeks no longer saw the Spartan army as invincible. It has to be remembered that the massive loss of land counts for much as well. For example the 'heiresses' could no longer uphold their wealth if a third of their land or more was suddenly no longer in their possesion. This meant that not only did the spartans lose their ability to field a massive army, they also lost the power to fund it.\n\nWhile this does not completely account for the MASSIVE loss in influence and manpower, it  was without a doubt the start of the decline. It was probably, as you said, that they were not willing to change their ways after losing half of their helot/worker population",0,0,

ppGCbh8ggUs,"22:20 \n\nI think you answered you own question in this video. Because Sparta raised it's soldiers from men who owned plots of land provided by the government, the less land owners the less soldiers. And because over centuries these lands accumulated to wealthy families it meant there was less public land to distribute and less soldiers to raise.\n\nThey couldn't alter the course of this accumulation of wealth because of the conservative nature of the government. \n\nPretty similar to what happened to Rome. Strong army in the beginning by giving it's male citizens plots of land and raising them into an army but then the wealth accumulated and the armies weakened. \n\nI quess it's difficult to avoid that phenomena of accumulating wealth and through that power to a small part of the population because those who could stop this are the ones benefitting. So basically the greed of a few made these empires collapse.\n\nMaybe this tells something about what happens when you can inherit great wealth. Wealth accumulates and along that power. Then the government that was supposed to look after the nation is primarily concerned with their personal wealth.\n\nWhat could've the government done? Well nothing really. If even a considerable portion them would've wanted a reform to distribute public lands again it would've required majority. If the king wanted it he would've basically needed the other king to murder the elders together to make it happen. And even then what is the backlash to such an action? Civil war would be highly likely. The two kings would have to enforce their laws by force. And what after? Would they reinstitute the same system or work as 2 kings. The 2 king system is definitely ending with a civil war or an assassination to form a dictatorship. \n\nSo it doesn't really seem like there was any other course that this form of government was going to go through with that structure.",0,0,

I think that those were interesting points to be considered: a geographical power whose only strength was it's military capabilities having said capabilities cut short led to an eventual downfall, that the pride and lack of reforms made sure to continue.\n\nLastly, archaic freaks or achaean-c freaks?

You invert Mario to create Wario – Mario turned septic and libertarian – then you reflect the inversion in the reflection: you create a being who can only exist in reference to others. Waluigi is the true nowhere man, without the other characters he reflects, inverts and parodies he has no reason to exist. Waluigi’s identity only comes from what and who he isn’t – without a wider frame of reference he is nothing. He is not his own man.

u6iVspBWzZU,"Okay so this is no way me trying to get sympathy, because I am doing very well mentally. This is mainly out of curiosity. So, summer 2016 I was really really I'll, basically I was in and out of hospital for a month, I had three surgeries and basically lost a lot of weight. Anyway, I went back to school four days after getting out of hospital (only for like an hour a day) and it definitely tired me out a lot. Basically what I'm trying to say is that during my recovery time I'd feel a lot of things described in the video. It wasn't constant (like it is for Dodie) but a lot of the time I'd feel like I was almost in a dream, and nothing really felt real. I wasn't too worried as it didn't happen for long periods at a time and it didn't happen lots. Also my memory of when I was ill is quite foggy and I can't pinpoint specific moments. So, I was wondering if you can get derealisation that only lasts for a short time. Because once I got better it stopped happening. I'm fine now so don't worry, I'm just curious if that's what it was as I'm trying to learn more about mental health illnesses so I can be more helpful to friends who might go through these thing.",0,0,
u6iVspBWzZU,"i don't know what type of dissociation i suffer from but i believe it's some type of mix between derealisation and depersonalisation. when i experience it (which is quite often) it feels like a different world in my head. it's basically like i'm writing a book/a whole different universe every time i experience it. it is a continuous story but when i get tired of it or when somehow i start writing a new world the older one doesn't feel right anymore and it stresses me out to force myself to continue with the older one. everybody in my universe (i believe that they're called paracosmos in the literature world) has their own set story and life and thoughts and i can project myself onto any of them and live as them and that's how i deal with my real life issues - i make up some storyline that somehow makes my character feel in a similar way to the way i'm feeling irl and deal with it by not being myself per say. some characters are reoccurring since i was 14 (i have experienced this since i was 12 but i recall moments when i was 7/8 of very similar situations) and others die with the paracosmos i leave behind (i still remember them and their lives and all of that jazz, and sometimes i bring them back) (characters can stay alive but i change parts of their storyline and you know i make sure they fit into whatever world i picture). it is mostly triggered and stimulated by audio and visuals and when i watch a movie or a tv show and a character from those really speak to certain parts of me i almost always make sure to include parts of them in my paracosmos (i don't know if i'm expressing myself correctly). i also feel very attached and connected to them. i do lose keep track of time and sometimes space when i experience this and i do have gaps in memory because of this. i also have a really weird sense of time like it still feels like 2012 in my head (i was 12 at the time). i also experience this involuntarily when i'm in a not so positive mood and have lots of stress and anxiety or when i'm sad and all that jazz. when i'm happy it cools down a bit and i can sort of choose when to write it? like i know that if i listen to music when i'm happy i will dissociate and i know that if i'm walking by myself i will also do it etc. aside from this when i'm living in the real world i do experience feeling like i'm out of my body and i'm not inside of it (specially in social situations and when i have to interact with people) it feels like i'm in a movie you know? there's a lot more stuff that goes around this thing but i feel like i've written too much so i'm going to keep it to myself. also sorry if there are any mistakes i'm not a native english speaker x",0,0,
u6iVspBWzZU,"Hey, I wanted to share my story if anyone is listening so uhm yeah if you want to read it you can, I just wanted to since I've never talked about it before\n\n\nSo since I was born my mother has had depression, anxiety and severe OCD. Not the clean kind of OCD, the hoarding. So for 12 years I live in copious amounts of trash and filth, and of course I was never allowed friends over. I was constantly verbally abused by her but I never really understood what that meant at the time. It got so bad I had to share a bedroom with my dad, brother and me. Thankfully my dad and brother moved out to a house next door that we previously rented. It's still too ugly and mouldy to ever invite friends (I've never had a birthday party) but I'm so so thankful that I actually get to move around my house and freely enter any room without being bombarded with trash... Sorry if this is tmi I've just never told this to anyone, not even my counsellor. I'm 13 years old now and it still really affects my day to day life. I've never been diagnosed with anything but I have self harmed and had one suicide attempt. I constantly feel pessimistic about my future. I get good grades, but I'm extremely anti social. I'm scared I'm going to develop Asperges, a genetic mental disorder my mum carries. My uncle has it and because of it I've never met him, same with my grandma. Sorry if this is a little weird, but it feels good to let it out.",0,0,

u6iVspBWzZU,"Great video, this is super interesting! I experience a few of these on and off occasionally and im ok with dealing with them a lot but when I'm worse especially when I'm panicked in a situation I can't get out of I get more physical things like painful pins and needles around my face and neck and the feeling like my skin crawling, what feels like really violent shivers down my spine,  is this a form of depersonalisation or just a physical manifestation of panic? I've always just called it depersonalisation because it seems like it would be but idk, I've always been curious.\n\nI'd like to try more types therapy though, I want to go back to talk therapy as it helped me a lot, especially with bigger things?  but I don't know if other things are worth trying more for the long term. Not excepting all the answers from youtube comments but still 😂❤",0,0,
u6iVspBWzZU,"I'm not gonna say I have this stuff, but I tend to have episodes where everything feels like a dream and very distant. For a while I would have small moments of depersonalization, and during school years, I would have up to almost a month at a time or at least most of a week I will/would just have empty busy times. In those times I just go through life without thinking and barely remember what happens when I come out of it. I get really touchy a lot and I have a friend who used to physically latch onto people and when she did that to me, I got stressed and had that distant feeling and that feeling usually meant in a few days I would have those empty periods of time.\nI don't know, though. Just don't attack me, because I'm only saying I have similar experiences and am very paranoid and idk why, but I'm not going to diagnose myself.",1,0,

I'm defiantly not self diagnosing but I think I relate with a lot of this.   \nI was wondering if it's possible to have more of a less severe case of derealization",1,0,

They make my day better :)\n\nSecondly, I would like to say that I'm a 20 year old Music Education student and I was wondering if music therapy could be an option that you've considered for derealization/depersonalization. I'm not a doctor, but I do strongly believe in the results that music therapy can bring. I'd like to maybe know your thoughts about it too :) Does Britain have any programs like this (I'm from Canada and I do know it's becoming more popular here)? Could this be another helpful thing for people with this disorder?\n\nI don't want to seem bossy or anything; I'm just curious about what you think and I'd like to help in any way that I can haha. \n\nKeep making videos Dodie and keep being an inspiration because you are doing amazing things :) Thanks :)",0,0,

u6iVspBWzZU,wow I've had derealization and depersonalization and I didn't know what was wrong but this helped me out so so much.

u6iVspBWzZU,"This video made me realize that I have had moments of derealization and depersonalization in the past. Last year, when I was at school, I just felt like I was floating through a dream that never ended. Youtube has helped me feel those emotions again and all of the sudden the feelings would go away! Something about school triggers it, but I don't know what. With depersonalization, I often, since I was very little, have felt disconnected with my body. I would look at my hands and feel weird, and try stomping my feet to make me feel connected, but nothing would work. I just felt like I was floating separate from my body. Eventually, it would pass, and I never thought much of it. Now, I can put a name to it and try to tell people how I feel! Thank you so much for making this video, it helped me a lot! \nLots of love!",0,0,

It looked really great in the beginning but obviously oxidized to be WAYYYY to dark by the end of the video. In front of all of my studio lights I couldn't tell but it's very obvious on camera. I love the foundation but will definitely be picking up a lighter shade!",5566,240,

Mq9dxmh6JiE,Hey hey! \nI liked your review and you were honest about your opinion. Not everyone will like everything and that's okay. The foundation is great but it not only matches skin tone but the undertone as well and the one you picked up is a bit warm and you might be on the cooler/pink side. I don't like Sephora's lighting and they have done me in from time to time as well.,0,0,

But other than that...u talk quite fast,0,0,
Mq9dxmh6JiE,"I'm getting annoyed that people think just because Fenty foundation is water base and also per Riri doesn't oxidized; assume it's not going to oxidized . Foundation does get darker. Doesn't matter what situation .  What plays in is the person's skin type, how their bodies natural PH levels on the skin reacts to the formula , how much humidity is in the air, what products they put on before hand can cause a small chemical reaction to the foundation. Just because one is selling out doesn't mean it will work for you and your body chemistry.  There's a basic science to it . I hate how almost everyone in the makeup community thinks they are gurus ; yet don't know that hooded eyes can't have the same cat eye wing angle as almond shape eyes. Or something as simple as foundation . Unless you are certified in the field or know the chemistry behind it, please don't deem a product horrible if it doesn't work for you .Also if a product does work for you , doesn't mean the person who had a harder time with it doesn't know what they are doing . Simply means it's not for them . \n       Sincerely a makeup enthusiast.",0,0,

A clown was still a credible disguise. \nBy moving the setting up 30 years, you make Pennywise's modus operendi rather dubious.

Or important information needed to be dumped/sniffed from the target email address, website, a particular location, or for whatsoever reason you want to hire a Hacker Or As a parent you might need to monitor what your children are doing on social media and on their personal computers so that they don’t get into trouble. Or if you want to hack a private domain email account(business email), or you want to eraze your name from court’s criminal records, perhaps you might want to Hack into the database of any government agency, All these are what I can get done within few hours.\n\n\nFrankly speaking, I always give a 100% guarantee on any job I am been asked to do, because I have always been successful in Almost all my jobs for the past 10years and my clients can testify to that . To hack anything needs time though, but I can provide a swift response to your job depending on how fast and urgent you need. Time also depends on what exactly you want to hack and how serious you are. Enough time with social engineering is required for hacking. So if you want to bind me in a short time, then just don't contact me because I can't hack within one hour,*sorry*. Basically, time depends on your luck. If its good luck, then it is possible to hack within one hour but, if its in the other way round, it would take few hours. I have seen FAKE HACKERS claiming they can hack in 1hr , but there is no REAL HACKER who can say this (AVOID THEM). \n\n\nIf your target account is Facebook, MySpace, Twitter, sexual accounts or other social accounts etc, or you want to hack into someones smartphone so you can monitor their calls, read their messages, chats, and social account activities without their notice, Or you wana track someone’s location, Or you want to retrieve lost files,messages, feel free to contact me, we would have a nice deal!

tx20wIAA_IE,"It's somewhat important to remember that sending people free stuff is advertising just as much as starting a campaign with commercials and ads and such; and paying people to share your product just by giving it to them can be both _much_ cheaper _and_ more effective than the more traditional techniques. (Even without expectation that you'll tell anyone you got it, the simple fact that people have a natural/social impetus to say thank you for a gift means that shotgunning a bunch of these out to people with audiences, it's probably well worth it to the brand.)\n\nI've encountered concern about the ethics of this sort of advertising--when brand deals, which pay _much_ more, are also a thing, this technique starts to seem pretty dodgy. Especially since it's an appeal to the brand's supposed generosity (which I suppose isn't always fake--you may well simply have a fan at Google who added you to that list, for example); or, more to the point, it's an appeal to the idea that the brand has done _you_ , the creator whom we love, a favor, and thus we should consider supporting them in return: an idea which can be very dishonest when we consider the opportunity cost to a professional content creator of accepting this sort of advertising.\n\nSORRY FOR THE DEPRESSING ECONOMICS DISCUSSION I just feel this is something more people should be aware of, whatever their conclusions about it. :S",0,0,

The yellow jackets attacked them and when they ran across the street in my direction I was stung several times. Didn't know it at the time but I was allergic to bee stings, this caused me to swell up bad and be admitted to the hospital.

Ng5OHYQ8FII,"Rio talks sense. England kid with two golden boots. 50 goals in two years before turning 20. Owen would be neymar level in term of money right now. The fact he's English slaps on another 50mil. At that age, you could not see past him as the next up and coming player. But what happened he got pushed too much too early and could have had a brilliant career that lasted long. Instead it finished up short. Keep young players ticking slowly. Let them develop. Then make him into the player you need",42,27,

Yes Rashford is playing a lot but now he's adapting his game to convert to a winger whereas Owen was a striker and woodburn just straight up is getting no game time. Imo Woodburn should go to Swansea or somewhere on loan and he could flourish.,4,0,

Mbappe has shown glimpses of that but he needs to do it over the course of a season or two. Rashford is rather different. He's more of a support striker than a poacher number 9.",8,2,

Ng5OHYQ8FII,Rio dont even mention Mbappe in this context mbappe has proven his worth in the UCL the biggest competition out there...,10,48,
Ng5OHYQ8FII,rashford has been poor so far this season he's been having episodes of poor games but the English media will try a defend him until he's 24 and done nothing and it will be on to the next  teenager. We should look at how the French bring their young players they don't buss ppl ear with their names. They let talent speak for itself. Personally I don't see the hype in rashford at part from the fact that  the British media are saying his name every week. This is pathetic.,3,10,
Ng5OHYQ8FII,Owen was a phenomenal player as a young talent but injuries made him an average player and for me didn't deserve that ballon D'or he won,7,7,

Ng5OHYQ8FII,"look at these old guys trying to cling on to their past status. haha .... Owen is dogshite compared to the players of today... Rio just bitter because he was always a liability, not as good as a defender like a Pique, luiz or a Terry who are also better then all those past overrated defenders too  (Adams, Campbell, Moore, Cannavaro, Nesta, Hiero, etc ...are all  below their level!)\n\nLuke Shaw is twice the player Maldini ever was (in fact he is better then carlos and maldini combined)\nwhy would you want a dirt player like cafu when you can play a great like Alvares?!?!?!\n\nWho would play overrated rubbish like a Scholes... a Keane... a Viera... < all crap players compared to todays (Hhahahah)\nEven Zidane is looked all rose tinted on... he was also rubbish... players like Coutinho are already better then players like him.\n\nAnd forwards and wingers... the past like to say so called greats like Maradona (the druggie)... Pele (the pervert)... R9.... (the fattie)... Best (the drunk)... Cruyff (the clown).... are better then the grerats cr7 and Messi and Neymar and Mbappe... hahahahaha\n\nIf old players that do punditry like Rio, Owen, Henry, Neville (etc) want to still get involved they can become todays boot cleaners because they were all rubbish and overrated",4,15,

Bad form.\n0:38 - Only reason that guy survived all those hits is his Mask of the Mother giving him 10% extra HP.\n0:50 - Obvious fat-rolls. Either Solaire is just being ballsy by reducing his invincibility frames, or he bought an item from a stall prior and it's stuffed up his weight ratio.\n1:28 - Solaire summoned in but the group is AFK. Promptly uses Black Separation Crystal to leave.\n1:50 - Silly Solaire. You cannot hurt someone whilst they're resting at a bonfire. What do you think this is, Dark Souls 2?\n2:02 - No damage taken by Solaire's hits? Dirty 'Cheat Engine' users.\n2:21 - I'm guessing Solaire is farming that Man-Serpent Summoner for its Medicant's Staff? Obviously doesn't get it as we never see Solaire with the Sunlight Shield.\n2:35 - Solaire vs. red invader dual-wielding Avelyns.\n2:48 - Solaire breaks his weapon on phase-2 Darklurker. Feels bad man.\n2:56 - Solaire vs. Aldrich, Devourer of Gods.\n3:04 - Picking on 2 harmless undead? WTF Solaire!\n3:14 - Fighting Marvellous Chester is a bad idea, but I understand. We all love that helm for Fashion Souls.\n3:49 - Solaire vs. Elana, Squalid Queen.\n4:05 - Solaire attempts to turn Sailor Moon towards the Sun's grace, but then stabs the filthy Darkmoon.\n4:16 - Solaire learn to fear the Frostbite build.\n4:30 - Using a Greatbow in a close-range fight? Bad idea.\n4:46 - Another invader dual-wielding Avelyns. They're everywhere!\n4:59 - Stop hitting people resting at bonfires, Solaire!\n5:09 - 3 vs. 1. Solaire spell-cancels for a sneaky hit. Lands a devastating blow on Hashirama at 5:30. Absolutely devastating.\n5:38 - Epic PvP battle between Solaire and a Chaos Blade wielder. Close match, but Chaos Blade wielder forfeits due to too much health drained from her own weapon (20HP each hit adds up quickly).\n6:24 - Praise the Sun!",0,0,

NhNxeEAt41A,"Has Science have discovered God?\n\nBased on the Harvey and the Irma hurricanes destructive effect on the state of Texas and the state of Florida plus the raging fires of California we could say that God is real and whenever man says that his laws, here in the United States of America, should be above the laws of God then we all get into big, big trouble.\nFor instance, according to the Bible, God made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, but he rested on the seventh day (Exodus 20:11). Therefore, God’s authority of how things should be done on earth is much higher than the authority of President Trump, the United States Congress and the United States Supreme Court of Justice and above the authority of all American voters put together. When non-believers in God, as described by the Bible, atheists, secularists and evolutionists take the Bible out of the public square and out of public teaching the influence of God’s Holy Spirit is greatly diminished within the American population and the United States, like other nations where God’s Ten Commandments are ignored and violated generates many assassins, rapists, thieves and people making false accusations against others.\nFor instance, places where we have people with widespread lack of knowledge of who Jesus and His Apostles were plus their specific teachings such as in the Key West, Florida, the crime index measures the rate of crimes in any area on a scale of 1 to 100, with 100 being the safest areas. This area earns a two on that scale. In other words, 98 percent of areas in United States of America are safer than this one, making it the most dangerous area in Key West and one of the most dangerous in the nation. Moreover, places where Jesus’ teachings are widely ignored such as in Houston Texas, we will find out that Houston’s murder numbers are posted for 2016 and they remain at a five-year high. Records show 302 people were killed 2015, leaving behind families who were ripped apart. You'll find that the occurrence of violent crime in Houston, TX is 135% higher than the average rate of crime in Texas and 159% higher than the rest of the nation. Those crimes are committed because God’s authority is diminished in the hearts and minds of people that are highly unfamiliar with God’s Ten Commandments in Exodus 20:3-17 and the teachings of our Lord Jesus Christ according to the New Testament in the Bible",0,0,
